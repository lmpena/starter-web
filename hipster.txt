Welcome, in this video, I'm going to demonstrate how to add

new files to a Git repository. First of all I have a few URLs

that I want to bring to your attention. The first one is the bitly URL

to the Git repository on GitHub that we're using.

If you haven't already, go to this URL and fork it into your personal repository;

I have a prior video that covers this in detail.

The next two URLs will be where I'm getting the filler text

for this and other videos for covering the Git basic concepts;

since source files are just text files, then any type of text will do.

So, starting off, I'm going to be using some ipsum lorem as dummy text

in order to cover the basic Git concepts. The first URL is "meettheipsums.com",

which is a collection of ipsum lorem websites that you can get for filler text.

The specific website I'll be using in this demo will be "hipsum.co",

which is the Hipster Ipsum website. Now I'm going to go over to my terminal;

so back on the terminal, I'm currently in my user's home directory.

So, if I do a "pwd", and press enter, you can see that I'm in my user's home directory,

which is also notated by the "~". Within my user's directory, I have a

"projects" folder, so I'm going to "cd projects", and now I'm going to press enter.

And, if I do an "ls", you can see that I have my "starter-web" repository.

So now I'm going to go there; "cd starter-web".

Now that I'm there, I'm going to clear. Now I have modified my prompt

to always display the current branch in my Git repository,

so your screen may look a little different than mine;

please see my bonus content on how to do the same for your environment.

So, within the Git repository, I'm going to do an "ls",

so now you can see all the files that are in the working diretory,

and, before I do any work, I'm going to do a Git status.

So, you can see that I'm on the master branch, and that it's

"up-to-date with 'origin/master'.", which is the reference back to my

GitHub repository. Since we haven't done anything yet,

the working directory is clean, which means there's nothing to commit.

The "git status" command, moving forward, will tell us the difference between

the working directory, Git's staging area, the actual Git repository

that is on the local system, as well as how that compares to the remote repository.

So, great, now I'm going to clear, and the first thing I want to do is add a new file.

And, to do so, I am going to use my text editor,

which I have set up in a previous demo, which is TextMate.

So I'm going to type "mate", and I'm going to call it "hipster.txt", press enter.

That's going to invoke TextMate, and it's ready for some text.

So, I'm going to go over to my web browser, and I already have a tab

setup on the hipster ipsum website. The defaults are fine,

and "Beer me!', is just the hipster ipsum's cute way of saying

just give me some text. Great, so now I'm going to just select the first paragraph,

copy it, and now I'm just going to go over to TextMate, and paste it in.

Now it's time to save, which is command+s, and close without quitting,

which is command+w. Now I'm going to return to my terminal, so if I do an "ls",

you can see the "hipster.txt" is in our folder. So let's see what Git thinks of this file.

So, if I do a "git status", Git tells me that there is one untracked file,

and it also tells me how to add that file so that Git can track it.

So, let's do that now; so "git add", and then the name of the file "hipster.txt",

press enter. Now if we "git status" again, Git tells us something slightly different;

it tells us that we have changes to be committed, and then it tells us the new file,

"hipster.txt". This is Git's way of saying "this is in the staging area of Git".

That is, this file is not yet committed, but it is something that Git is tracking

and it's awaiting the next commit. So now, in order to proceed forward,

we just have to type "git commit".

Now, if I do this without specifying any additional parameters,

my default editor will show up for the commit message.

Great, well let's type a commit message: "My first commit".

Great, now let's save, and then close. Once we close our editor,

Git will use whatever we put into the editor as our commit message.

All the hash marks are commits that are not committed.

So, let's look at our commit; so the "git commit" command returned

master, which is the current branch that it commits on, and then this weird text

"ba5" and so on. That's the SHA-1, which is a unique identifier for the commit,

followed by the actual commit message, which we entered into our text editor.

The next line tells us we had "1 file changed", which resulted in "1 insertion",

and the last line tells us which file actually was changed.

Great, well let's do another "git status",

now, this time, Git tells us that we're ahead of "origin/master" by one commit.

It also tells us that we have nothing to be committed,

and that our working directory is clean. When you do commit,

everything that's in the staging area is committed,

which means there's nothing left in the staging area after the commit,

and, in this case, I didn't have any other pending changes in my working directory.

So, after the commit, I do have a clean working directory.

Also, the Git status command keeps track of "origin/master",

which is our reference back to our remote repository on GitHub,

and then it just lets us know that our repository is just a little different.

That's important to know, because many of our commands in Git are local.

So, to illustrate that, let's go back to our remote repository back on GitHub.

So, this is the Git repository on GitHub that we cloned from.

Which, in itself, is actually a fork of the upstream repository. It's on master branch

and so, if I do a reload, you'll see the same files that we had from before.

There currently is no "hipster.txt" file here. That just reiterates that

the commit command was actually a local operation;

it did not impact our remote repository. In order to do that,

I'll go back to my terminal here, and the "git status" command actually tells us

what we need to do in order to affect our remote repository;

we need to push any changes that we have, actually local commits,

up to our remote repository. But, before I do that,

I'm going to do one other command first; this is the "git pull".

So if I type "git pull origin master", this will update our repository

with any changes that may have happened on the remote repository

down to our local repository, just to make sure we're up-to-date

before we do any pushes back up to our remote repository.

This is a best practice; I recommend always doing a pull before doing a push.

So now, if I press enter, it tells me that I'm already up to date,

which is not surprising, since I'm the only one working against that remote repository.

However, If you are working on a team, and you had multiple

developers or contributors putting their code in the same repository,

then you might get out of sync, which is why this is the best practice.

So, now that I'm confident that my repository is up-to-date with the remote repository,

it's safe to push my changes back up to the remote repository.

So, in a similar command, "git push origin master".

Now, I should kind of explain what "origin" and "master" mean here;

so the "git push" command will push any commits from the local repository

to the remote repository by reference name,

as well as the branch that you want to push.

So, "origin" is the name of the remote repository that we cloned from:

hence it's named origin. It's just a convention, but I kind of like it.

The next parameter is "master", which is our master branch;

it's the only branch we have right now. But in this command

I'm going to specify both the remote reference, and the branch name.

So now, press enter, and you may be prompted for your username and password

to get back to GitHub; since you're making changes to your remote repository,

then you need to log in with your credentials. Once you've done that press enter.

And, as long as you entered your credentials correctly,

Git should push up all your changes that you have on your local system

up to the remote repository. So, at the bottom, we can see that it confirms

that it pushed the changes to my copy of the "starter-web" Git repository on GitHub.

It also tells me which commits were involved;

so, basically, it pushed the commit "5c05047" up to "ba5b0f0",

which is also master to master, so my local master to my remote master.

Well, let's go see if that actually happened. So let's go back to our browser,

and now if we hit refresh or reload, we should see a new file:

"hipster.txt", and even the commit message, "My first commit!".

If we click on the file, you can see the contents of that file.
